                <h3>Design and Drawing services</h3>
                <p>An architect will listen to your ideas and help you shape them into a brief. They’ll draw a building design and communicate this design using two- and three-dimensional drawings, sketches and models. Architects use those colour or black and white drawings to communicate with yourself and team members in meetings.

 

At 50 Degrees North, our specialism is residential architecture. We work on new homes, groups of homes, and enhancing our clients’ existing homes. The three things that we provide are creativity, inspiration, and ideas.

                <h3>Paperwork</h3>
                <p>Aside from the design and build element, home extensions generate a lot of paperwork. An architect’s service is invaluable during the pre-planning preparation, when submitting planning applications and during the build. Here’s how an architect’s service helps you with the vast array of paperwork that needs to be managed.

                <h3>Network(an architect's team)</h3>
                <p>An architect will have a network who can help deliver your project. From builders to tradespeople, consultants to contractors, an architect worth their salt will have a packed little black book. Whatever service you may need, they’ll know more than one person who provides that.
